             users to easily deploy, manage, and scale MongoDB databases.

        - The cloud is like using a service or storing data online instead
            of on your own computer. You can access it from anywhere with the internet.

// Inside the Database
/*
    - A collection is a group of documents (like JSON objects).
    - A schema defines the structure of those documents. (filieds, types, ...)
    - A model is a tool in Mongoose that uses the schema to interact with the collection.

// Life Cycle Transfer the Data to DB:

    To store user data in MongoDB you need to:
        - Create a server to handle requests. --> use Express

    In Details:
        define Routes (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH) --> with server
        Use PostMan to send request Database:
            "http://localhost:3000/post"
            "http://localhost:3000/get"
            "http://localhost:3000/put"
            "http://localhost:3000/patch"
        Run the App and make server listen to post 3000

        - MongoDB Compass: is a graphical user interface (GUI) has a lot of features 
            like databases visually, providing features like data exploration,
            querying, schema analysis, and performance monitoring.*

        - MongoDB Atlas:  is a fully managed cloud database service that enables
             users to easily deploy, manage, and scale MongoDB databases.

        - The cloud is like using a service or storing data online instead

// Life Cycle Transfer the Data to DB:
/*
    To store user data in MongoDB (using Compass for managing the data), you need to:

        - Create a server to handle requests. --> use Express
        - Send requests to the server. --> server send data to DB
        - The server will then store the data in MongoDB. --> You can use MongoDB Compass to view and manage the dat
*/

// Deal With DB
/*
    To CRUD from DB:
        POST /api/tasks : add Data to DB
        GET /api/tasks : Get the Data from DB
        PUT /api/tasks/:id : Update Date in DB 
        DELETE /api/tasks/:id: Delete from DB
*/

// Details in CRUD with DB
/*
    1. Store Data in the Database: First, you send a request 
        (like a POST request) to the server to store data in the database.

    2. Server Handles the Request: The server processes
        the request and performs the CRUD operation on the database. For example:
        For adding data: It uses POST to store data.
        For fetching data: It uses GET to retrieve data.
        For updating data: It uses PUT to modify data.
        For deleting data: It uses DELETE to remove data.
    
    3. Send Response Back from DB to Server.
*/


// More Concepts
/*
    - Schema: Defines the structure of the data (fields and types).
    - Model: Represents a collection in the database and provides
        methods to interact with it.
    - Collection: The group of documents (data) in the database
        (created automatically by Mongoose using the model).
